# Qiskit 2.x Practice Exams

This is a repository where I will be adding practice tests to prepare for the IBM Qiskit 2.x exam. 

Each exam includes 20 questions and a key at the end of the document. 

In each exam, the questions cover the different sections of the syllabus that must be prepared, while also maintaining the same percentages of questions from each section.
Some questions are easy. Others are more complex even than the ones in the exam. The idea is being prepared as much as possible for 'the real thing'.
